# Fipsified Optick GPU profiler API

This doesn't build the actual profiler app, but instead provides an easy way to use the API in your fips projects. See [Optick: C++ Profiler For Games](https://github.com/bombomby/optick) for usage samples.

Note: Currently excludes the vulkan integration, just change the glob to include it. This probably should be configurable.
